# Security policy

This document gathers security-related policies and guidelines for the codebase available in this repository.

This libraries help developers create [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) applications. The libraries are composed of different modules with different functionalities.

* Some modules help with reading and writing data in Solid servers. Data should always be considered sensitive and be processed with care and regards to access restrictions and personal information.
* Some modules help with Authentication. Authentication is a sensitive domain, and as such we designed these libraries with a particular attention to security. In particular, we decided to apply the following rules:
  * Comply with the [OAuth security guidelines](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-15.html). This involves, among other things:
    * No support for the implicit grant and the resource owner password grant
    * The use of a PKCE token
    * Binding tokens to a DPoP key to make them sender-constrained whenever possible
  * Short-lived tokens (e.g., ID token and Access token) and private cryptographic material (e.g. a DPoP private key) are loaded in memory, so that they may not be extracted once received from the remote server. These protected elements will not be made available directly (e.g. through a method call) or indirectly (e.g. allowing to sign a header with the DPoP key) to any third-party.
