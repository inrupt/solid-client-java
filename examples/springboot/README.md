# Digital Book Library on a Pod

You are building the next-generation digital book library based on Solid. You can think about some similar services such as Goodreads and Audible personalized to your experience. To start you must implement a prototype first, a command-line interface application that only works for your user.

  ## The following user stories (US) will help:

    * US1: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to authenticate to my digital book library available on my Pod (see available resources to access your Pod).
    
    *  US2: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to add a book to my digital book library (on my Pod).

    * US3: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to edit the description of a book from my digital library (on my Pod).

    * US4: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to delete a book from my digital library (on my Pod).
    
    * US5: As a digital book library owner I want to be able to read the details of a digital book.

    A friend of yours has a list of really cool books. It is a collection of books compiled by all her closest friends. Your friend's list is also in a digital library on her Pod. She gives you access to that list in the form of an access grant (see available resources).

    * US6: As a digital book library owner I want to read the book list my friend shared with me and gave me access to.

    * US7: As a digital book library owner I want to write to my friendâ€™s book list she gave me write access to, an additional book title.
