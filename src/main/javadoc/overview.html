      <a href="https://inrupt.com">Inrupt</a> provides libraries for Java developers to
      harness the power of Solid. These libraries are designed to work with any server that
      conforms to the published <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR">Solid specifications</a>.

    <p>
      The goal of these libraries is to provide highly flexible, simple components that can be used
      in any Java application for Solid, including differnet layers of abstraction:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interface Layer:</strong> generic interfaces, authentication related interfaces and service interfaces</li>
      <li><strong>Core Modules Layer:</strong> HTTP interaction, JSON processing and RDF processing, Authentication & Authorization</li>
      <li><strong>Domain-Specific Modules Layer:</strong> default API implementations, Solid related data models, WebID profile data model</li>
    </ul>
