    <p>
      Inrupt provides libraries for Java developers to harness the power of Solid. These libraries
      are designed to work with any server that conforms to the Solid specification.

      in any Java application for Solid, including:

    <ul>
      <li>Authentication components</li>
      <li>Data mapping components</li>
      <li>Resource management components</li>
    </ul>
