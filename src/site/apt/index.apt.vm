* Getting started

** Example code

    First, we assume we have an existing <<<testResource>>> which points to the root container of a Pod (a Pod's storage). And we also assume we have an authenticated <<<session>>>. Something like in the following code:

---------------------
var session = ClientProvider.getClient();
var webid = URI.create((String) claim);
var session = client.session(OpenIdSession.ofIdToken(idToken));
---------------------

    For an extensive example of how to fetch these resources, see the {{{quarkus-demo}Quarkus demo}}.

    Further we exemplify how a user can create a Solid resource and add a boolean triple to it. We make use of the Jena implementation for RDF processing. Remark: The <<<createDeleteInsertSparqlQuery>>> is constructing a sparql DELETE DATA and INSERT DATA string based on the two provided lists.

---------------------
final var newResource = testResource + "e2e-test-subject";
final var newResourceURL = URI.create(testResource + "e2e-test-subject");
final var predicate = "https://example.example/predicate";

// We create the Solid resource if it does not exist
final var requestCreateIfNotExist = Request.newBuilder(newResourceURL)
        .header("Content-Type", "text/turtle")
        .header("If-None-Match", "*")
        .header("Link", Headers.Link.of(LDP.Resource, "type").toString())
        .PUT(Request.BodyPublishers.noBody())
        .build();
final var resp = session.send(requestCreateIfNotExist, Response.BodyHandlers.discarding());

if (resp.statusCode() != 204) {
    throw new InruptClientException("Failed to create solid resource at " + newResource);
}

// If the resource already exists, we get all its statements and filter out the ones we are interested in
final var statementsToDelete = new ArrayList<Statement>();
if (resp.statusCode() == 412) {
    final var requestRdf = Request.newBuilder(newResourceURL).GET().build();
    final var responseRdf = session.send(requestRdf, JenaBodyHandlers.ofModel());
    statementsToDelete = responseRdf.body().listStatements(ResourceFactory.createResource(newResource), ResourceFactory.createProperty(predicate)).toList();
}

// We create a list of statements we want to add
final var statementsToAdd = List.of(createStatement(ResourceFactory.createResource(newResource), ResourceFactory.createProperty(predicate), ResourceFactory.createTypedLiteral(true)));

final var ur = UpdateFactory.create(createDeleteInsertSparqlQuery(statementsToDelete, statementsToAdd));
final var requestPatch = Request.newBuilder(newResourceURL)
    .header("Content-Type", "application/sparql-update")
    .method("PATCH", JenaBodyPublishers.ofUpdateRequest(ur)).build();
final var responsePatch = session.send(requestPatch, Response.BodyHandlers.discarding());

if (responsePatch.statusCode() != 204) {
    throw new InruptClientException("Failed to create a new resource at " + newResource); //create appropriate exception
}
---------------------

** Quarkus demo

    The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/demo/quarkus/package-summary.html}demo module}} contains a Quarkus application to look up a user's WebID profile and then display the contents of a user's storage.

    To set up the example application the following configuration values need to be added for this to work properly:

---------------------
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=<URL of Solid-OIDC server>
quarkus.oidc.client-id=<URL of Client Identifier>
---------------------

    Remark: <<<client-id>>> is a {{{https://solid.github.io/solid-oidc/#clientids-document}Client ID Document}}. You can use the {{{https://client-identifiers.tools.inrupt.com/generator}Client Identifier Helper tool}} to generate or validate one.
    
    The above configuration values are typically added to a <<<./config/application.properties>>> file in the directory where the application is run.

    To run the application, use this command:

---------------------
$ java -jar demo/quarkus/target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
---------------------

    The application will be available at <<<http://localhost:8080>>>.

* Inrupt's Java Client modules and layers

  Inrupt's Java Client Libraries are composed of different modules that follow a layered architectural approach. Next we will provide an overview of these layers and how to make use of them.
  Make sure to visit the {{{./apidocs/}Documentation}} part for a javadoc style documentation with code examples for each module. 

* Interface Layer

** API

  The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/package-summary.html}api module}} is an interface module used in mostly all following modules. The provided abstractions are implemented in higher level modules and can be used to plug in your own application specific implementations.

  There are several specific parts to the API module

  * Classes and interfaces used by developers writing Solid apps. These form the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/package-summary.html}standard api}} of the Inrupt Java Client Libraries.

  * Classes and interfaces used by developers extending these client libraries. These interfaces comprise the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/spi/package-summary.html}spi}} package and will be used for implementing support for a new JSON processor or HTTP client library.

  * Classes and interfaces used by developers building domain abstractions. These interfaces comprise the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/rdf/package-summary.html}rdf}} package and are helpful for translating RDF data into specific Java classes.

* Core Modules Layer

  The next listed modules make up what we call the core modules layer of the Java Client Libraries. See these modules as basic building blocks on top of which further Solid and then application specific implementations can be developed. 

** Authentication & Authorization

  Authentication & authorization are processes part of verifying the identity of an agent. To access private data on Solid Pods, you must authenticate as a user/agent who has been granted appropriate access to that data.

  Inrupt's Java Client Libraries provide different layers of abstraction to be used when needing authentication and authorization.
  Low level modules include OpenID and UMA.

*** OpenID

  The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/openid/package-summary.html}openid module}} builds on top of the {{{which itself builds on the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework.}OpenID Connect}} standards, which itself builds on the {{{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749}OAuth 2.0}} authorization framework.

*** UMA

  The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/uma/package-summary.html}uma module}} builds on top of the {{{https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html}UMA}} specification.

  Remark: Higher level abstractions that help with authentication and authorization are part of the Core module. This module includes classes such as <<<DefaultClient>>> which encapsulates a reactive authentication approach. This class makes use of the basic authentication and authorization modules to automatically determine the preferred authentication and authorization the server needs and then negotiate the according tokens and access. See {{{example-code}Example code}} for how to use the DefaultClient.

** HTTP interaction

  For interacting with a Solid server through a HTTP client there are two low level modules available: the java.net {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/httpclient/package-summary.html}HttpClient}} or the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/okhttp/package-summary.html}OkHttp}}.

*** HttpClient

  This module build on top of the {{{https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/package-summary.html}java.net.http.HttpClient}}.
  For example code and usage visit the javadoc at the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/httpclient/package-summary.html}httpclient module}}.

*** OkHttp

  This module builds on top of the {{{https://square.github.io/okhttp/}OkHttp}} client.
  For example code and usage visit the javadoc at the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/okhttp/package-summary.html}okhttp module}}.

** RDF processing

*** RDF4J

  {{{https://rdf4j.org/documentation/}RDF4J}} is one of the widely known RDF processing libraries for Java.
  For example code and usage visit the javadoc at the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/rdf4j/package-summary.html}rdf4j module}}.

*** Jena

  {{{https://jena.apache.org/documentation/javadoc.html}Jena}} is one of the widely known RDF processing libraries for Java.
  For example code and usage visit the javadoc at the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/jena/package-summary.html}jena module}}.

** JSON processing

*** JSON-B

  {{{https://javaee.github.io/jsonb-spec/getting-started.html}JSON-B}} is providing a Java API for JSON Bindings.
  Visit the {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/jsonb/package-summary.html}jsonb module}} javadocs for examples of how to make use of it in Inrupt's Java Client Libraries.

*** Jackson

  {{{https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson}Jackson}} is the Java JSON library that helps you parse and work with JSON.
Visit the {{{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/jackson/package-summary.html}jackson module}} javadocs for examples of how to make use of it in Inrupt's Java Client Libraries.

* Domain-specific Modules Layer

** Implementation of all API interfaces

  The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/core/package-summary.html}core module}} provides implementations of all API interfaces. Among which also a client implementation for use with Solid resources.

** Solid resource data models

  The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/solid/package-summary.html}solid module}} provides handlers for Solid resources and containers.

** WebID Profile data models

  The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/webid/package-summary.html}webid module}} provides a handler for working with the Solid WebId profile document.

** Verifiable Credential data models

  The {{{https://inrupt.github.io/solid-client-java/apidocs/com/inrupt/client/vc/package-summary.html}vc module}} exposes VC-API interfaces used in Solid.
