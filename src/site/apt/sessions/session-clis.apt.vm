Command Line Applications

    Command-line applications will typically operate on behalf of a single user. For this type of interaction,
    you will need to establish a "client credential" using a few pieces of information that are retrieved from
    an identity provider such as the Application Registration page on
    {{{https://login.inrupt.com/registration.html}Inrupt's OpenID Provider}}. After logging in to the identity provider, you can register a new application and in turn, get:


      * <<<client_id>>>

      * <<<client_secret>>>

    In addition, you will need an <<<issuer>>> value, which in this case is <<<https://login.inrupt.com>>>
    and an <<<authentication_method>>>, which will be <<<client_secret_basic>>>.

    Building a session with this information will make use of the <<<OpenIdSession.ofClientCredentials()>>> method as in the following example.

+---
public class MyApplication {

    public void run() {
        URI issuer = URI.create("https://login.inrupt.com");
        Session session = OpenIdSession.ofClientCredentials(issuer, "<your-client-id>", "<your-client-secret>", "client_secret_basic");
        ...
    }
}
+---

* Next Steps

    If you are using one of the high-level clients and you have a working <<<Session>>> object, you can move on to the {{{./data-modeling.html}data modeling}} section, which describes how to bind Java objects to RDF resources.
