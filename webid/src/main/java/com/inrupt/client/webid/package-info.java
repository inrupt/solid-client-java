/**
 * 
 * <h2>WebID Profile support for the Inrupt client libraries.</h2>
 *
 * <p>This module contains a BodyHandler which consumes the actual response body bytes
 *  and converts them into a {@code WebIdProfile} Java object.
 *
 * <p>The following example reads a Solid WebID profile and presents it as a {@code WebIdProfile} Java object:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
        Request request = Request.newBuilder()
            .uri(URI.create("https://webidserver.example/"))
            .header("Accept", "text/turtle")
            .GET()
            .build();

        Response<WebIdProfile> response = client.send(
            request,
            WebIdBodyHandlers.ofWebIdProfile(URI.create("https://example.example/username"))
        );
        System.out.println("HTTP status: " + response.statusCode());
        System.out.println("WebID URI: " + response.body().getId());}
 * </pre>
